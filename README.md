# 🚆 TrainTrack: Lost & Found Web Application

## 1. Introduction

**TrainTrack: Lost & Found** is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of reporting and finding lost items in train stations or trains.  
The platform allows users to post details of lost or found items, view other users’ reports, and use **AI-based visual matching** to identify similar items.  
This system bridges the communication gap between passengers and authorities by creating a **centralized, user-friendly solution** for lost-and-found management.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Provide a digital platform for reporting and tracking lost or found items.  
- Ensure user authentication and data security using **Firebase**.  
- Use **Artificial Intelligence** for image-based similarity detection between items.  
- Enable administrators to monitor, verify, and manage user reports effectively.

## 3. Technologies Used

| **Category** | **Technologies** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend / Database** | Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore |
| **Image Hosting** | [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) |
| **Machine Learning** | TensorFlow.js (MobileNet Model) |
| **Admin Verification** | Firestore user roles with custom rules |
| **Deployment** | Pending (to be hosted on Firebase Hosting or Vercel) |

## 4. System Overview

### 🔑 Authentication Module
- Sign up, login, and logout functionalities.  
- Firebase Authentication integration.  
- Private routing for authenticated users.

### 📦 Lost/Found Posting Module
- Users can submit item details with image links (hosted on ImgBB).  
- Data stored securely in Firestore.

### 📊 Dashboard Module
- Displays all reported lost and found items in a grid layout.  
- Filtered and dynamically updated from Firestore.

### 🧾 Item Details & Contact Reporter
- Displays full information about a selected item.  
- Includes a **“Contact Reporter”** button that opens an email client using a `mailto:` link.

### 🤖 AI Image Matching
- Uses **TensorFlow.js** with **MobileNet** to generate image embeddings.  
- Compares new items with existing ones using **cosine similarity**.  
- Displays the top three visually similar items as **“Possible Matches”**.

### 🛠️ Admin Dashboard
- Admins (users with `role: "admin"`) can view all posts and user data.  
- Admins can delete inappropriate or duplicate entries.  
- Displays key statistics (total posts, users, lost/found ratio).

---

## 5. Firestore Security Rules

### Normal Users
- Can read all items.  
- Can create or modify **only their own** posts.  
- Can view and update their own user document.

### Admin Users
- Can access all documents in `items`, `users`, and `messages` collections.  
- Can delete or update any post.  

Access control is enforced using a helper function `isAdmin()` in Firestore rules.

## 6. Machine Learning Integration

The application integrates **TensorFlow.js (MobileNet)** to compute image embeddings for uploaded items.  
Each image is converted into a **vector representation**, which is compared with other item embeddings using **cosine similarity**.  

Results are displayed as **“Possible Matches”**, showing users items that look visually similar.  
This approach is **lightweight**, **client-side**, and requires **no backend computation or external API costs**.

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Implement text-based matching using **NLP embeddings** for item descriptions.  
- Add **geolocation support** for nearby station detection.  
- Integrate **push/email notifications** when a potential match is found.  
- Deploy the application using **Firebase Hosting** or **Vercel**.  
- Add **multi-language support** for better accessibility.

## 9. Conclusion

**TrainTrack: Lost & Found** demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can enhance real-world systems for social benefit.  
It provides a **practical, secure, and intelligent platform** that combines user-friendly design, robust authentication, and visual similarity analysis to improve lost item recovery efficiency in railway systems.
